# Ankart - my own shopping app
Ankart is an miniature version of shopping apps.
To build this app, i used MYSQL to create the databases, wrote the neccessary function in PYTHON language, 
used FLASK to make API calls and finally used ANDROID STUDIO for app construction.
It has 5 activities which function according to their names.
1. login activity
2. Register activity
3. Homepage Activity (It contains the item-list to select items to do shopping)
4. View cart activity (It displays all the items added to cart by the user)
5. View order activity (It displayes all the order done by the user)
